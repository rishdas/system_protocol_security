#purpose:  program to illustrate how functions work
#          this program will compute the value of 2^3 + 5^2.  Next it
#	   finds the maximal number.  You need to alter the code
#	   so that before it finds the maximal number, it puts the
#	   output from the power function into the first position in
#	   data_items.

#purpose:  This function is used to compute the value of a number
#          raised to a power.
#input:  first argument - the base number.
#        second argument - the power to raise it to
#output:  will give the result as a return value
#notes:  the power must be 1 or greater
#variables:
#               %ebx - holds the base number
#               %ecx - holds the power
#               -4(%ebp) - holds the current result
#               %eax is used for temporary storage
